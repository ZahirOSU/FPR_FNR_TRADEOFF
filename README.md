# FPR FNR Tradeoff Module 

This directory contains notebooks that showcase FPR and FNR tradeoff  which responsible to adjust the base predictions to meet the client False Positives and False Negatives requirement based on the confidence threshold.
To use the notebooks as intended, please make sure that you install the Python libraries in your virtual environment
from the `../requirements.txt` and `../requirements_notebooks.txt` files.

We recommend doing the following steps:
1. Create a virtual Python environment and install all dependencies from `../requirements.txt` and
`../requirements_notebooks.txt`.
2. Add the virtual environment's kernel to iPython's kernel list - see [these instructions][ipython_add_kernel] for how
to do this.
3. Start Jupyter notebook server/Jupyter lab and use the added kernel that will include the installed dependencies.
